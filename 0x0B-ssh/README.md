## Learning Objectives

### General

1. **What is a Server?**
   - Understand the concept of a server and its role in computing.
   - Learn how servers provide various services, such as hosting websites, managing databases, and more.

4. **How to Create an SSH RSA Key Pair:**
   - Learn the steps to generate an SSH RSA key pair.
   - Understand the components of the key pair: public key and private key.

5. **How to Connect to a Remote Host Using an SSH RSA Key Pair:**
   - Explore the process of connecting to a remote host using the `ssh` command.
   - Understand the use of the private key for authentication and secure access to remote servers.

6. **Advantage of Using #!/usr/bin/env bash Instead of /bin/bash:**
