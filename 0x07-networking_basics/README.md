# Networking Basics #0

This project covers essential networking concepts and topics to help you gain a foundational understanding of computer networking. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of external resources.

## Learning Objectives

### OSI Model
- **What it is:** Understand the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which defines how different networking protocols and technologies interact.
- **How many layers it has:** Identify the seven layers of the OSI model and their functions.
- **How it is organized:** Understand how the OSI model is structured, from the physical layer to the application layer.

### LAN (Local Area Network)
- **What is a LAN:** Define what a Local Area Network is and its primary purpose.
- **Typical usage:** Explain common scenarios where LANs are used.
- **Typical geographical size:** Describe the typical physical size of a LAN.

### WAN (Wide Area Network)
- **What is a WAN:** Define what a Wide Area Network is and its primary purpose.
- **Typical usage:** Explain common scenarios where WANs are used.
- **Typical geographical size:** Describe the typical physical size of a WAN.

### The Internet
- **What is the Internet:** Explain what the Internet is and how it connects networks worldwide.

### IP Address
- **What is an IP address:** Define an IP (Internet Protocol) address, which is used to identify devices on a network.
- **What are the 2 types of IP address:** Differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

### Localhost
- **What is localhost:** Understand the concept of "localhost," a hostname that refers to the current device and is often used for testing network services locally.

### Subnet
- **What is a subnet:** Explain subnets, which are logical divisions of IP networks used for network organization and optimization.

### Why IPv6 was created
- **Why IPv6 was created:** Describe the need for IPv6 and how it overcomes the limitations of IPv4.

### TCP/UDP
- **What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema):** Identify TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as the primary data transfer protocols.
- **What is the main difference between TCP and UDP:** Explain the key differences between TCP and UDP, such as reliability and connection-oriented vs. connectionless communication.
- **What is a port:** Define a port number, which is used to identify specific services or processes on a device.

### Memorize SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers
- **Memorize SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers:** Remember the standard port numbers for these common network services.

### What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
- **Check device connectivity:** Understand the tool or protocol used to verify if a device is connected to a network.

## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed editors:** Use vi, vim, or emacs for your scripts and documentation.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure your Bash script files are compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Line Endings:** All your files should end with a new line.
- **README.md:** Create a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- **Executable Scripts:** Make sure all your Bash script files are executable.
- **Shellcheck:** Your Bash scripts must pass shellcheck without any errors.
- **Script Headers:** The first line of all your Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- **Script Comments:** The second line of all your Bash scripts should contain comments explaining the purpose of the script.
