# 0x0C. Web Server

## Learning Objectives


### General

1. **Main Role of a Web Server:**
   - Understand the primary function of a web server as a software application responsible for serving and managing web content to clients over the internet.

2. **Child Process:**
   - Define what a child process is in the context of operating systems and web servers.
   - Explore the role of child processes in handling client requests and improving server efficiency.

3. **Parent and Child Processes:**
   - Learn why web servers usually have a parent process and multiple child processes.
   - Understand how the parent process manages and spawns child processes to handle concurrent client requests.

4. **Main HTTP Requests:**
   - Identify and explain the main HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more.
   - Understand the purpose of each HTTP request type in client-server communication.

### DNS

5. **What DNS Stands For:**
   - Define DNS as the Domain Name System, a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

6. **DNS Main Role:**
   - Understand the primary role of DNS in resolving domain names to corresponding IP addresses, facilitating communication between clients and servers on the internet.

### DNS Record Types

7. **A Record:**
   - Explain the A (Address) record type in DNS, which maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.

8. **CNAME Record:**
   - Define the CNAME (Canonical Name) record type, used to create aliases or nicknames for domain names.

9. **TXT Record:**
   - Understand the TXT (Text) record type, which allows domain owners to associate arbitrary text with a domain.

10. **MX Record:**
   - Explain the MX (Mail Exchange) record type, specifying mail servers responsible for receiving emails on behalf of a domain.
