# 0x19 Postmortem

## Overview

This document serves as a postmortem report for the incident labeled 0x19, detailing the outage that occurred on February 17, 2024, and its resolution. The purpose of this postmortem is to analyze the incident, identify its root cause, outline the actions taken to mitigate it, and propose corrective and preventative measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.

## Incident Summary

- **Date and Time:** February 17, 2024, 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM (UTC)
- **Duration:** 5 hours
- **Impact:** The outage affected 30% of our users, resulting in slow response times and intermittent service disruptions across our web platform.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfigured load balancer caused an imbalance in traffic distribution, leading to server overload and degraded performance.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating high server latency.
- **10:15 AM:** Engineering team alerted by monitoring system.
- **10:30 AM:** Initial investigation focused on database performance due to recent schema changes.
- **11:00 AM:** Assumed root cause to be database query optimization issues; DBA team engaged.
- **12:00 PM:** Database performance tuning yielded no significant improvements.
- **12:30 PM:** Escalated incident to network infrastructure team.
- **1:00 PM:** Discovered misconfigured load balancer as the root cause.
- **2:00 PM:** Load balancer configuration corrected, traffic evenly distributed.
- **3:00 PM:** Service fully restored, performance stabilized.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** The load balancer was misconfigured, causing uneven distribution of incoming traffic among backend servers. This resulted in some servers becoming overloaded while others remained underutilized.
- **Resolution:** The misconfiguration was corrected by adjusting load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic across backend servers. Additionally, monitoring systems were updated to provide real-time alerts for similar issues in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated configuration checks for load balancers to prevent misconfigurations.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to detect traffic imbalances and server overloads more effectively.
  - Conduct regular audits of network configurations to identify and address potential issues proactively.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Update load balancer configuration scripts to include validation checks.
  2. Enhance monitoring alerts to trigger notifications for traffic distribution anomalies.
  3. Conduct a thorough review of all network infrastructure configurations for potential misconfigurations.
  4. Schedule regular training sessions for engineers on best practices for load balancer management and network configuration.

## Conclusion

The web stack outage on February 17, 2024, was caused by a misconfigured load balancer, resulting in degraded performance for a subset of our users. Through timely detection and swift corrective actions, we were able to restore service within five hours. Moving forward, we will implement measures to prevent similar incidents and ensure the continued reliability of our platform.
