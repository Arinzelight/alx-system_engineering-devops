# Web Stack Debugging #2

This repository contains solutions for the third installment in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these projects, broken or bugged web stacks were provided in isolated containers, and the task was to fix them and bring the web stack to a working state. For each task, a script was written to automate the commands necessary to resolve the issues.
