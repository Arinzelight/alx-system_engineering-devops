# Web Infrastructure Design Project

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of web infrastructure design and associated concepts. You should be able to explain the intricacies of the web stack you built during the sysadmin/devops track projects. Here are the specific learning objectives:

### General

1. **Diagram Proficiency:**
   - Create a detailed diagram that encompasses the entire web stack built in the sysadmin/devops track projects.
   - Illustrate the relationships and interactions among different components in the web infrastructure.

2. **Component Functionality:**
   - Explain the purpose and functionality of each component within the web stack.
   - Understand the role of key elements such as servers, databases, load balancers, and other components in the infrastructure.

3. **System Redundancy:**
   - Define and explain the concept of system redundancy.
   - Understand the importance of redundancy in ensuring high availability and mitigating risks of system failures.

4. **Acronym Mastery:**
   - Familiarize yourself with and be able to articulate the meanings of key acronyms related to web infrastructure:
     - LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl)
     - SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
     - QPS (Queries Per Second)

### README.md Structure

To facilitate the understanding of the web infrastructure design, consider structuring your README.md file as follows:

#### 1. Introduction
   - Briefly introduce the purpose and significance of web infrastructure design.

#### 2. Diagram
   - Present the comprehensive diagram of the web stack.
   - Include annotations or legends to explain the function of each component.

#### 3. Component Overview
   - Provide a detailed breakdown of each component in the web stack.
   - Explain how they collaborate to deliver a functional web application.

#### 4. System Redundancy
   - Discuss the concept of system redundancy.
   - Highlight specific redundancy measures implemented in the web infrastructure.

#### 5. Acronym Definitions
   - Define and elaborate on the acronyms LAMP, SPOF, and QPS.
   - Offer practical examples or scenarios to illustrate their relevance.

#### 6. Conclusion
   - Summarize the key takeaways from the web infrastructure design project.
   - Emphasize the importance of a well-designed and redundant system for optimal performance.

By the end of this project, you will have developed a strong foundation in web infrastructure design and be capable of articulating its complexities and best practices without relying on external resources.
