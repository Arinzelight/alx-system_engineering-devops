# Networking Basics #1

This project covers fundamental networking concepts and topics to help you gain a foundational understanding of computer networking. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the need for external resources.

## Learning Objectives

### General

- **What is 0.0.0.0:** Explore the purpose and significance of the "0.0.0.0" IP address in networking.

- **What is /etc/hosts:** Learn about the "/etc/hosts" file, which is used for custom hostname-to-IP address mappings. Understand how it can be used to override DNS resolution and control local hostnames.

- **How to display your machine's active network interfaces:** Discover how to view the active network interfaces on your machine, which can be useful for network configuration and troubleshooting.
